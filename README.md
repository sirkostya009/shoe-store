# Shoe Store

### Description
Shoe store is a set of microservices and a React app that allows potential customers to browse, buy and review shoes.

This project was written in just 5 days as a cumulative homework assignment for one of my uni subjects.

### Running
To run the project, you need to have docker installed. Then, run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
After successfully running docker, just start the rest of the microservices and the frontend app, and test it.
No further configuration is necessary.
